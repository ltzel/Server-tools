# Server-tools
# Synopsis
I have created this project to share some Python scripts that I use to monitor remote servers. I will add more information
 when I have some free time.
The Server-tools include the following tools:

1. Server check. Checks whether a node (e.g. localhost:8080) is up
2. Disk check. Shows the percentage of the disk usage of a remote server(ssh).

The tool provides a GUI using the tkinter library. The server information can be configured directly to the 
config.conf file or using the configuration tab.
